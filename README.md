# 🌍 [Cross-View UAV Geo-Localization with Precision-Focused Efficient Design: A Hierarchical Distillation Approach with Multi-view Refinement]  


This is the official PyTorch implementation for our paper **"Cross-View UAV Geo-Localization with Precision-Focused Efficient Design: A Hierarchical Distillation Approach with Multi-view Refinement"**.

In this project, We propose **Precision-Focused Efficient Design (PFED)**, a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge transfer and multi-view representation refinement. 🚁

---

## 🌟 Efficiency analysis

**PFED** achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching `97.15% Recall@1` on University-1652 while being over `5x` more efficient in `FLOPs` and `3x faster` than previous top methods. 

Furthermore, PFED runs at `251.5 FPS` on the `AGX Orin` edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for `real-time` UAV applications.

We will update this repository for better clarity ASAP, current version is for quick research for researchers interested in the cross-view geo-localization task.

## ⚙️ Installation

We recommend using `conda` to create a virtual environment.

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SkyEyeLoc/PFED.git
    
    cd PFED
    ```

2.  **Create environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # (Optional) Using Conda
    conda create -n [your_env_name] python=3.10    
    conda activate [your_env_name]
        
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Prepare datasets:**
    
    Please download the dataset from [University1652](https://github.com/layumi/University1652-Baseline), [SUES-200](https://github.com/Reza-Zhu/SUES-200-Benchmark) and unzip it into the `./data` directory.

## 🚀 Quick Test

We provide the following `.mat` file for quick evaluation of the model's performance.
[Download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mmIp8HotaW0hBTC3zTxYKm1o_1ET8Ity?usp=drive_link)

You can use `Tools/evaluate_norm.py` to evaluate the performance.
**Please note to replace with your own files path.**
```bash
python evaluate_norm.py
```

## ⚖️ Training & Evaluation

#### Training





## 🤗 Weights

[Download link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZjssipR0RGfoPaETo4QhsQ?pwd=ahi4)


Choose the weight and **unzip** it. Then put it in the root path in the working directory for your repo.

PS: 

- `model_2024-11-02-03-05-31` is the weight for 30-degree UniV (2fps) and `model_2024-10-05-02_49_11` is the weight for 45-degree UniV (2fps)
  - The evaluation number should be the same as our paper
- By tuning hyper-parameter, we can get a better result.
